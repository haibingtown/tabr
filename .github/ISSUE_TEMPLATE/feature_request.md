<!--

Before filing a feature request, please consider if it fits the scope of the package, conforms (or can conform) to package syntax rules and programming expectations, and is of sufficient general utility that the feature may be used by many other users. This is especially true for transcription related requests. These are a couple common reasons feature requests may be declined.

1. Do you want to hack apart the string of LilyPond syntax generated by `phrase()` ad hoc? Why? Can your problem be reformulated?

`phrase()` is not intended to create arbitrary LilyPond markup. You may want to consider just using LilyPond directly. The `lilypond()` function exists so that you can create a LilyPond file rather than rendering it to sheet music. This is so that you can spot edit it after creating it if `phrase()` cannot meet your needs. There is a lot in LilyPond that tabr will never do. If your needs are great, you may be leaning on tabr too much. If there is a need to manipulate the string result of phrase, this speaks to a broader more fundamental problem somewhere else, which may not may not be worth resolving with tabr, but the answer is not to do LilyPond syntax post-processing.

2. Do you want your own unique music syntax?

This generally conflicts with tabr's fundamental syntax rules. It also does not benefit users of the package in general, but can add confusion. tabr has syntax converters that are officially added and supported, but these are reserved for well-known popular syntax formats like music21 that are used and understood by many people. Several users have made their own external wrappers around tabr functions to meet their unique needs and syntax preferences. This is the recommended approach in such cases.
