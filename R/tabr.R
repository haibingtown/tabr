#' tabr: Music notation syntax, manipulation, analysis and transcription in R.
#'
#' The \code{tabr} package provides a music notation syntax system represented
#' in R code and a collection of music programming functions for
#' generating, manipulating, organizing and analyzing musical information
#' structures in R.
#' The package also provides API wrapper functions for transcribing musical
#' representations in R into guitar tablature ("tabs") using the 'LilyPond'
#' backend <http://lilypond.org>.
#'
#' LilyPond is an open source music engraving program for generating high
#' quality sheet music based on markup syntax.
#' \code{tabr} generates LilyPond files from R code and can pass them to
#' LilyPond to be rendered into sheet music pdf files from R.
#'
#' While LilyPond caters to sheet music in general and \code{tabr} can be used
#' to create basic sheet music,
#' the transcription functions focus on leveraging LilyPond specifically for
#' creating quality guitar tablature.
#'
#' \code{tabr} offers a useful but limited LilyPond API and is not intended to
#' access all LilyPond functionality from R,
#' nor is transcription via the API the entire scope of \code{tabr}.
#' If you are only creating sheet music on a case by case basis, write your own
#' LilyPond files manually.
#' There is no need to use \code{tabr} or limit yourself to its existing
#' LilyPond API.
#' If you are generating music notation programmatically,
#' \code{tabr} provides the ability to do so in R and has the added benefit of
#' converting what you write in R code to the LilyPond file format to be
#' rendered as printable guitar tablature.
#'
#' While LilyPond is listed as a system requirement for \code{tabr}, you can
#' use many of its functions without installing LilyPond if you do not intend
#' to render tabs.
