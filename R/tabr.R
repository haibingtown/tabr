#' tabr: Music notation syntax, manipulation, analysis and transcription in R.
#'
#' The \code{tabr} package provides a music notation syntax and a collection of
#' music programming functions for generating, manipulating, organizing and
#' analyzing musical information in R.
#'
#' The music notation framework facilitates creating and analyzing music data in
#'  notation form.
#' Music data can be viewed, manipulated and analyzed while in different
#' forms of representation based around different data structures: strings and
#' data frames.
#' Each representation offers advantages over the other for different use cases.
#' Music syntax can be entered directly and represented in character strings to
#' minimize the formatting overhead of data entry by using simple data
#' structures, for example when wanting to quickly enter and transcribe short
#' pieces of music to sheet music or tablature.
#' Functions exist for directly performing various mathematical and
#' organizational operations on these strings by checking their music syntax
#' validity and adding custom classes and methods to these strings.
#' The same music data can also be organized in tidy data frames, allowing for
#' a more familiar and powerful approach to the analysis of large amounts of
#' structured music data.
#' Functions are available for mapping seamlessly between these data structures
#' and their representations of musical information.

#' The package also provides API wrapper functions for transcribing musical
#' representations in R into guitar tablature ("tabs") and basic sheet music
#' using the LilyPond backend <http://lilypond.org>.
#'
#' LilyPond is an open source music engraving program for generating high
#' quality sheet music based on markup syntax.
#' The package generates LilyPond files from R code and can pass them to
#' LilyPond to be rendered into sheet music pdf files.
#'
#' While LilyPond caters to sheet music in general and \code{tabr} can be used
#' to create basic sheet music,
#' the transcription functions focus on leveraging LilyPond specifically for
#' creating quality guitar tablature.
#'
#' The package offers nominal MIDI file output support in conjunction with
#' rendering sheet music.
#' The package can read MIDI files and attempts to structure the MIDI data to
#' integrate as best as possible with the data structures and functionality
#' found throughout the package.
#'
#' \code{tabr} offers a useful but limited LilyPond API and is not intended to
#' access all LilyPond functionality from R,
#' nor is transcription via the API the entire scope of \code{tabr}.
#' If you are only creating sheet music on a case by case basis, write your own
#' LilyPond files manually.
#' There is no need to use \code{tabr} or limit yourself to its existing
#' LilyPond API.
#' If you are generating music notation programmatically,
#' \code{tabr} provides the ability to do so in R and has the added benefit of
#' converting what you write in R code to the LilyPond file format to be
#' rendered as printable guitar tablature.
#'
#' While LilyPond is listed as a system requirement for \code{tabr}, you can
#' use the package for music analysis without installing LilyPond if you do not
#' intend to render tabs.
