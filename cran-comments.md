## This is an update release.

* Previously suggested by CRAN maintainter that functions that create MIDI files via LilyPond should be turned off with `\dontrun{}` because they take too long to execute. These are now turned off.
* Other bug fixes and updates.

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of rtrek 
(https://github.com/leonawicz/rtrek/blob/master/revdep/checks.rds). 
All packages passed.
