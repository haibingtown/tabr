# tabr 0.3.1

* Added `no_tab` argument to `track` allowing for suppression of tab staff when music staff is included, e.g., for vocal tracks.
* `no_tab`-associated documentation and unit test updates.
* Deprecated `dup` and `glue`. Now use `pn` for repeating phrases `n` times and `pc` for concatenating multiple phrases.
* Updated documentation, examples, vignettes and unit tests.
* Minor bug fixes.

# tabr 0.3.0

* Added `fretboard_plot` for making fretboard diagrams outside of the LilyPond tablature pipeline. This necessitates importing `ggplot2`.
* Added functions for phrase validation, coercion and decomposition back to original character string inputs.
* Added functions for note, pitch, chord and octave equivalence checks.
* Added a collection of functions for constructing and working with common chords. The chord constructors are among the `chord_*`-named functions and also have shorter `x*`-named aliases. These are "piano chords," i.e., based on the condensed, defining intervals.
* Added `guitarChords` dataset containing several thousand formations of guitar chord voicings.
* Added helper functions that use `guitarChords` for obtaining guitar chord information and mapping between different defining properties of a chord, most notably the addition of `gc_notes` and `gc_fretboard` for mapping chord names to noteworthy strings and fretboard diagram syntax.
* Added helper functions for working with basic note/pitch strings.
* Added helper functions for working with musical scales and modes.
* Added helper functions for working with musical intervals.
* Added `noteworthy` class, used internally, optional for users (includes custom print and summary methods).
* Added `mainIntervals` dataset.
* Added more internal checks of note and chord syntax validity across functions that work with string representations (pre-`phrase` object construction).
* Update older functions to utilize the new, more robust and stricter validation checks and offer more consistent `noteworthy` class output.
* updated `transpose` to handle additional edge cases, including a new style option, `strip`.
* Updated and added new unit tests.
* Bug fix for case where `NA`-valued no-chord rests (`s` or `r`) were unnamed in output of `chord_set`.
* Fixed entry in `tabrSyntax`.
* Fix class assignment bug and updated `as_phrase`.
* Added a new column of relative interval size to internal `.keydata` helper table.
* Added new vignettes focusing on the programming aspect of `tabr`.
* Updated documentation.

# tabr 0.2.0

* Refactored `tuplet` (and `triplet`) to accept a phrase object as well as a character string of notes. Previously, only notes were accepted but this was too limiting. The argument name has changed to from `notes` to `x` and `tuplet` will now check the class of `x` and handle phrase objects accordingly.
* Added handling of silent rests in note strings for `tuplet`.
* `sf_phrase` (and `sfp`) updated to allow returning early with only the notes string as opposed to the entire phrase object. This is useful if you just want a quick, cleaner string representation of what notes are mapped by string/fret combinations.
* Minor updates to `.onLoad` for non-Windows systems.
* Removed `tibble` package dependency. Using only `dplyr` suffices.
* Updated Readme and basic example intro vignette.
* Added and updated unit tests.
* Added `lintr` to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION per CRAN maintainer request regarding `testthat` unit tests.

# tabr 0.1.2

* Unwrapped `lilypond` example from `dontrun` tag.
* Switched to `tempdir()` location for examples that write files.
* Added LilyPond to SystemRequirements field in DESCRIPTION.
* Attempt to run file-writing examples and file-writing unit tests conditionally if LilyPond found on system.

# tabr 0.1.1

Adjustments to meet requirements for CRAN resubmission: 

* Updated DESCRIPTION.
* Adjusted file-writing locations for unit tests to use `tempdir`.
* Add `dontrun` tag around one last file-writing package example that was using `lilypond`.
* Update `lilypond`, `tab`, `midily` and `miditab` to work with system calls that use absolute paths for output files instead of only working with relative paths.

# tabr 0.1.0

* Added package scaffolding.
* Developed initial functions for music description and organization.
* Developed initial functions for generating LilyPond (`.ly`) files and wrapping around system calls to LilyPond for rendering sheet music to pdf or png.
* Added readme with basic example.
* Added initial vignette content.
* Added unit tests.
* Added support for custom, non-standard guitar tunings and instruments with different numbers of strings, up to seven.
* Added `.mid` to `.ly` and `.mid` to tab output convenience functions.
* Added support for multiple voices per staff.
* Added support for transposition of music staff relative to tablature staff.
