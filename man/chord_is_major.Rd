\details{
These functions operate based only on ordered pitches.
They do not recognize what a human might interpret and name an inverted chord with a root other than the lowest pitch.
This imposes limitations on the utility of these functions,
which scan the intervals for a minor or major third in a chord whose notes are sorted by pitch.

In several cases including single notes or no major or minor interval present, \code{NA} is returned.
\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} is only returned if such an interval is present. If more than one is present, it is based on the lowest in pitch.
It prioritizes major/minor and minor/major adjacent intervals. If these do not occur adjacent, it select the lowest third.
This is still imperfect, but a useful method. Second and higher unknown chord inversions are problematic.
